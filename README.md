# PWM Inverter Simulation

Some python scripts to help simulate an ideal PWM bipolar inverter. `inverter.py` allows for the basic control, triangle and output PWM to be observed or optionally just the FFT of the PWM. `overmodulation.py` is set up so that the amplitude modulation ratio can be tweaked and the effects of overmodulation observed.

These aren't great quality at the minute but I will update them to a usable state soon and add a unipolar mode too!
